Landscape configuration and community structure jointly determine the persistence of mutualists under habitat loss


This project models and visualizes the effects of habitat loss on mutualistic networks using Julia for simulation and R for data visualization. It includes time series analysis, spatial networks, and extinction-colonization dynamics.
